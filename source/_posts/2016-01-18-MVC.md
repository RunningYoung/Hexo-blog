#MVC

##Why MVC?

* Reusable
* Low coupling & High cohesion

##What's UIViewController

It's controller with some of logic about
 controlling views(loadView, viewWill..., viewDid...).  
 
It's reuseable.




##How about MVVM?

![](/attachment/MVC/mvvm.png)

VM in MVVM simplify view and viewcontroller,  and make view no longer need to depend model.

##How MVC works together?

###Communication

![](/attachment/MVC/mvc_comunication.png)

####View and Model 

View and model never comunicate to each other.

####Controller and View

**Target-action, delegate, block** are used to send msg from View to Controller.

Controller send msg to view directly.

####Controller and Model

**KVO, Notification, block, delegate** are used to send msg from Model to controller

>
Target-action, delegate, block, KVO, Notification are kinds of style of comunications.   
Target-action is like hot line.  
Delegate and block are like delegate.   
KVO and Notificaiton are similar as subscription service.  
But why we use certain one in a certain situation?   
Because they have different relationship.

###Relationship

####View and Model 

View may depend on model. Model can be a property of view.    
**Model in view is not model, it 's cache**.

Model never depend on view.

####Controller and View

Controller can depend on view, view never depend on controller.

A view instance is belong to **one** contrller instance.

####Controller and Model

Controller can depend on model, model never depend on controller.

A model instance is belong to **one or more** contrller instance.

##How MVCs work together?

Controller is responsiable for connect different controller in those MVC, it can not communicate to view in those MVC, but it can communicate to model in those MVC.

Model is public, view is private.

##So what is MVC?

###Model: Model Objects Encapsulate Data and Basic Behaviors

**Model objects represent special knowledge and expertise**. They hold an application’s data and define the logic that manipulates that data. A well-designed MVC application has all its important data encapsulated in model objects. Any data that is part of the persistent state of the application (whether that persistent state is stored in files or databases) should reside in the model objects once the data is loaded into the application. Because they represent knowledge and expertise related to a specific problem domain, they tend to be reusable.      

**Ideally, a model object has no explicit connection to the user interface used to present and edit it**. For example, if you have a model object that represents a person (say you are writing an address book), you might want to store a birthdate. That’s a good thing to store in your Person model object. However, storing a date format string or other information on how that date is to be presented is probably better off somewhere else.

###View: View Objects Present Information to the User & Pass User Order to Controller

**A view object knows how to display**, and might allow users to edit, the data from the application’s model. **The view should not be responsible for storing the data it is displaying**. (This does not mean the view never actually stores data it’s displaying, of course. A view can cache data or do similar tricks for performance reasons). A view object can be in charge of displaying just one part of a model object, or a whole model object, or even many different model objects. Views come in many different varieties.

###Controller: Controller Objects Tie the Model to the View

It represent business logic, **It know how to transform user action to the modification on Model, and how to transform Model to View that user can read it**. A controller object acts as the intermediary between the application's view objects and its model objects.    



Controller objects can be either reusable or non-reusable.
